Here's how the game works:

	* On page load, it will display the Stranger Things background with the option to start the game. 

	* Each question will have four multiple choices to choose from and 20 seconds to answer the question. 

	* If you select the correct answer, the screen will display an image from the show. 

	* If you select the wrong answer, the app will tell you the correct answer and direct you to the next question after a few seconds.  

	* If you run out of time, the app will tell you the time's up and display the correct answer. The app will direct you to the next question in a few seconds. 

	* On the final screen, the app will display the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
